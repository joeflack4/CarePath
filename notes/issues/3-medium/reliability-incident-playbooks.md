# Reliability / Incident Playbooks (Scenario 4)

- [ ] Create a brief runbook:
  - [ ] How to roll back deployment (e.g. `kubectl rollout undo`)
  - [ ] How to quickly scale replicas manually
  - [ ] How to locate logs and traces for a specific `trace_id`

- [ ] Define SLOs:
  - [ ] e.g. `/triage` p95 latency < 3s under normal load
  - [ ] Document basic error budget thinking
